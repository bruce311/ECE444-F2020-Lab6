Pros and Cons for TDD:
Test driven development allows developers to iteratively develop the project with the emphasis on setting up unit tests before committing to writting functions and features

Pros: 
TDD allows developers to find bugs easier. Because all tests are written a head of time. When developing the application, developers have a guildline to follow and need to make sure all the test cases pass before committing code changes. When a bug appears, developers can also quickly run the test cases and navigate themself in the code base to find the bug quicker. TDD will also allow easier code base refactoring and maintenance. Because code changes need to pass all the test cases before committing, developers can use the unit tests as guidline and support document before committing their changes. It also makes the cloud team working branch bug free.

Cons:
TDD requires a overhead time to set up. It often requires developers to think about test cases before actually writting any code. Also during the development process, all the test cases need to be updated and maintained every time a new feature or functionality is introduced. This would slow down the development time of the team and increase the complexity of project development.
